# ScoutApp

Welcome to Team 811's scouting app for the Steamworks Game.  This guide goes over how to use the app properly and what each part means.

First, there will be a Pick Game menu, use the Steamworks game menu only because the Stronghold game was used as a test and is not fully fuctional

Second, there will be a menu to lead to either the match scouting menu or the pit scouting menu.  Select the proper menu based on the type of scouting is being done.
